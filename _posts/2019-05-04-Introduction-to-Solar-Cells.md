# Introduction to Solar Cells

## The Importance of Renewable Energy

Nowadays, Oil and Coal are the most used energy sources, these forms of energy
are not renewable on a human timescale and cause increases in Carbon Dioxide
(CO2) emissions in the atmosphere.

Since the start of the industrial revolution, the amount of CO2 in the
atmosphere increased by 40% due to the combustion of fossil fuels. The increase
of CO2 is now causing the Earth temperature to rise. That’s because more
radiations that should have been expelled from the atmosphere at night are now
getting trapped by the greenhouse gases. Carbon Dioxide and Water are two
examples of greenhouse gases. They absorb radiations and re-transmit it in
random directions.

Anthropogenic climate change studies the climate changes caused by humans
instead of natural Earth’s activities.

According to the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), wind and solar energy are
amongst the cheapest forms of electricity. The LCOE takes into account all the
costs incurred in constructing, running and decommissioning a form of energy
production. LCOE does not include although additional costs due to variability
in energy produced.

## Physics of Semiconductor Materials

Semiconductor materials have characteristics between metals and insulators. This
makes them very interesting materials to work with in order to produce
electronic devices. In fact, by altering their properties, it can then be
possible to either make the device conductive or not according to the desired
operation mode.

Every material is formed by atoms, the configurations of these atoms and the way
they interact with each other to form a material determine its properties. A
band can be considered as a collection of energy levels. If an electron is part
of an isolated atom, it would be dependent only on its interactions with that
atom. When atoms get closer together to form materials, the electrons of each of
these atoms will not be subjects anymore to just the atom they belong to but
they will be subject to forces from also the other atoms. That makes each
electron be associated with not just an energy level but to a band of energy
levels.

There are two main types of bands (Figure 1):

* Valence band: it determines the optical and electrical properties of the
material. It is formed by the energy levels of the outer shell electrons.
* Conduction band: It is formed by the energy levels of the free electrons. Free
electrons are created when electrons in the valance band gain enough energy to
leave this band. The energy needed by the electrons to move from the valence
band to the conduction band has to be equal or greater to the size of the
semiconductor band gap. Free electrons are able to move freely throughout the
material.

## Why solar cells?

> “I have no doubt that we will be successful in harnessing the sun’s energy. … If
> sunbeams were weapons of war, we would have had solar energy centuries ago.”
<br> ― **George Porter**

Solar cells are electronic devices which use light shining on them to generate
current and voltage to create electric power. In the dark, a solar cell acts
like a diode (Red line in Figure 2, Equation 1 in Figure 3). Illuminating the
solar cell, thanks to the generation of electron-hole pairs, photons of light
can then be absorbed generating current flow (Blue line in Figure 2, Equation 2
in Figure 3).

If photons of light are absorbed, the electrons are then collected from the
conduction band by a selective contact and they are then driven around an
external load to produce electricity (Figure 4). Finally, a second selective
contact returns them to the valence band.

The Photovoltaic effect takes place if there is a small positive voltage across
the junction (ie. are present extra electrons on the n-side and extra holes in
the p-side). Nowadays, the Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) of commercially available
solar cells vary from a few % to above 30% depending on the technology.

Solar cells can be divided into three main fabrication generations (Figure 5, 2002).
Screen printed contacts solar cells are a first generation solar cell type (PCE
= 10–20%). Other examples of first-generation solar cells are Buried Contacts,
Interdigitated back contact (IBC), Heterojunction with Intrinsic Layer (HIT) and
Passivated Emitter Rear Locally Diffused (PERL). Thanks to advancements, the prices
of first-generation solar cells have dropped considerably during the last few years.
Second generation solar cells using thin films can instead now reach over 20% of PCE.
Finally, third generation solar cells will aim in the future to be more efficient than
the first two generations (PCE > 20%) while keeping affordable costs.

## Tandem Solar Cells

An example of a solar cell having high efficiency can be Multi-junction (Tandem)
solar cells. In fact, single junctions solar cells have a maximum theoretical
efficiency of 33.16%, instead, a solar cell formed by an infinite number of
junctions can reach up to 86.8% efficiency [4]. Single junctions solar cells are
in fact limited by the Shockley-Queisser limit (Tandem solar cells don’t).
Photons with energies below the bandgap can’t be absorbed by the semiconductor
while photons with energies greater than the bandgap can be, but the extra
energy gets lost as heat [5].

junction solar cells (Increasing EQE). Reproduced from: [6]</span>

Nowadays commercially available multi-junction (MJ) cells can achieve around 30%
efficiency. One of the main drawbacks of this technology is the high
manufacturing costs and complexity.

Multi-junction solar cells can achieve greater efficiency than their single
junctions counterparts because they are able to absorb a greater range of the
solar spectrum (Figure 6). This is done by creating multiple p-n junctions
formed by different semiconductor materials. The different materials are
therefore chosen so that to produce their maximum current at different
wavelengths (thanks to the multiple bandgaps). As shown in Figure 7, Tandem
solar cells usually make use of Indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) for the top
junction, Indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) for the middle junction and Germanium
(Ge) for the bottom junction.

materials. Reproduced from: [7]</span>

In multi-junction solar cells, the multiple layers are formed by stacking
single-junction solar cells on top of each other. The bandgap of the material at
the top is designed to be the greatest one, and the one at the bottom the
smallest one (the bandgap size decreases going down from one layer to another in
the solar cell). In this way, high energy photons are absorbed in the top layer
and low energy photons are still allowed to pass through the lower layers to
then get absorbed. The different single junctions are interconnected thanks to
tunnel diodes (heavy-doped p-n junctions). Without tunnel junctions, no current
would be able to flow between the different junctions (back to back diodes). One
of the main limitations when fabricating Tandem solar cells is to find the right
combination of materials that can allow the formation of this structure. One of
the most common solutions to this problem is the use alloys of groups 3 and 4
which allows bandgap tunability (eg. Gallium Indium Phosphate (GaInP), Gallium
Indium Arsenide (GaInAs), and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)) [8].

In 2018 Fraunhofer ISE (in collaboration with EVG), managed to create a
silicon-based tandem solar cell of 33.3% efficiency, this can be considered one
of the best example of nowadays solar cell technology holding a high power
conversion efficiency [9].
