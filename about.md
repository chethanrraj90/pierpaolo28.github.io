                                <p>As a freelance Research Data Scientist, I collaborated with a variety of business clients in sectors such as finance, retail and e-commerce. In each business project, I worked with clients to plan and deliver specialised solutions to solve their commercial data problems. One of the most interesting projects I worked  on was on analysing how changes in Stock Prices can affect different company shares parameters (Level 2 Data) and how can these be predicted. To do so, different techniques such as Feature Selection/Engineering
                                and Ensemble Learning have been employed. The role has developed my ability to work to a deadline to produce an excellent product, utilising A/B testing and version control tools such as Git.</p>
